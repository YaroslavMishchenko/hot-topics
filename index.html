            <h2>The Value of Money</h2>
            <figure>

            <p>Money is not the cause of wealth in one’s life. It is the effect. Similarly, when people assume that
                money is the cause of their problems, they are actually mistaken. Money is usually the most noticeable
                effect of their problems.

                Money is fluid. Its value only becomes realized when it’s put into motion. Therefore, money is a
                reflection of the owner’s values and intentions.

                Most people mistake being rich for owning lots of stuff or achieving some sort of fame or status. I
                could max out my credit card buying VIP tables in Vegas all weekend and take selfies with Ivanka Trump,
                but that doesn’t make me rich. On the contrary, it would make me kind of a douchebag.

                There is that old saying from Fight Club, “The things you own end up owning you.” Materialism, by and
                large, is a psychological trap. No matter how much you own, how much you buy, how much you earn, the
                disease of more never goes away. Meanwhile, you’re working longer hours, taking bigger risks, foregoing
                more and more parts of your life.

                Money is inherently neutral. It’s merely a vessel for the exchange of experience between two people. You
                make your money by creating experiences for others. You then give your money to others to receive
                experiences in return.

                Even when you buy some material good like a sports car or a diamond necklace, you’re not just buying the
                physical goods, you’re buying the experience of driving that car or wearing that necklace. You’re buying
                the experience of power, speed, or social status that’s associated with it. You’re buying that ornament
                to your identity, that knowledge of what owning and using it feels like and whether it makes you happy
                or not.</p>

            <p>Genetic modification is a special set of gene technology that alters the genetic machinery of such living
                organisms as animals, plants or microorganisms. Combining genes from different organisms is known as
                recombinant DNA technology and the resulting organism is said to be ‘Genetically modified (GM)’,
                ‘Genetically engineered’ or ‘Transgenic’. The principal transgenic crops grown commercially in field are
                herbicide and insecticide resistant soybeans, corn, cotton and canola. Other crops grown commercially
                and/or field-tested are sweet potato resistant to a virus that could destroy most of the African
                harvest, rice with increased iron and vitamins that may alleviate chronic malnutrition in Asian
                countries and a variety of plants that are able to survive weather extremes. There are bananas that
                produce human vaccines against infectious diseases such as hepatitis B, fish that mature more quickly,
                fruit and nut trees that yield years earlier and plants that produce new plastics with unique
                properties. Technologies for genetically modifying foods offer dramatic promise for meeting some areas
                of greatest challenge for the 21st century. Like all new technologies, they also pose some risks, both
                known and unknown. Controversies and public concern surrounding GM foods and crops commonly focus on
                human and environmental safety, labelling and consumer choice, intellectual property rights, ethics,
                food security, poverty reduction and environmental conservation. With this new technology on gene
                manipulation what are the risks of “tampering with Mother Nature”?, what effects will this have on the
                environment?, what are the health concerns that consumers should be aware of? and is recombinant
                technology really beneficial? This review will also address some major concerns about the safety,
                environmental and ecological risks and health hazards involved with GM foods and recombinant technology.

            <h2>The View of World in 2100</h2>
            <figure>

            <p>As world leaders gathered to mark the start of 2050, they looked back on the coronavirus pandemic 30
                years before as a turning point in the quest to rein in global warming. Nations pulled together to
                defeat the pandemic, and that launched a new era of cooperation to prevent a climate disaster.
                Investments in green energy and new technology yielded rapid cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide,
                putting the world on track to limit global warming to around 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.

                Or maybe not. In 2050, the world could look back and see the pandemic as little more than a blip in a
                long and mostly futile effort to stave off global warming. Despite a temporary drop in carbon emissions
                from the 2020 outbreak, countries turned to cheap fossil fuels to revive their economies after the
                crisis. Carbon emissions soared and temperatures followed, setting the stage for 5 °C of warming by the
                end of the century.

                These are just two possible visions of the future. Nobody knows how the current pandemic will play out;
                nor is it clear whether humanity will ultimately come together to avoid a potential climate catastrophe.
                But climate researchers need to explore what kinds of problem might emerge with different levels of
                warming. So they have developed a suite of scenarios intended to represent a range of futures that
                humanity could face1. Their goal is to investigate how different policies might alter carbon emissions —
                and how the planet will react to all of that heat-trapping gas.

                At one end of the spectrum, optimistic scenarios explore worlds in which governments join forces to
                advance low-carbon technologies while reducing poverty and inequality. The other end sees countries ramp
                up their use of cheap fossil fuels, pursuing economic growth at all costs.
